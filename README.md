Loan Approval Prediction

This project focuses on training a machine learning model to predict loan approval for clients based on their financial data and deploying this model as a REST API.

Task 1: Model Training and Evaluation

We have a dataset with client financial data and loan approval status.

Steps
Data Analysis
Feature Engineering
Model Selection and Training
Model Evaluation

Task 2: Model Deployment as a REST API

Deploy the model as a REST API using Python and Flask.

Steps
Python Application: Develop a Python application with:

Deliverables :
* Jupyter Notebook (KocFinans_case.ipynb).
* Dump of the final model (final_model.pkl).
* Encoder object (encoder.pkl).
* Requirements file (requirements.txt).
* Dockerfile (Dockerfile).
* Python code for the Flask application (app.py).
